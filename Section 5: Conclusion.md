## Section 5: Conclusion

## âœ… Conclusion

After evaluating the performance of four machine learning modelsâ€”**Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and **Stacking Regressor**â€”we identified **XGBoost** as the best-performing model for predicting actual flight fuel consumption.

With a **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** of just **534.23 kg** and an **RÂ² score** of **0.9880**, XGBoost demonstrated excellent capability in capturing complex, nonlinear relationships between flight characteristics and fuel usage.

The **Stacking Regressor**, combining XGBoost and Linear Regression, also delivered competitive results. It indicates that ensemble techniques may enhance robustness in real-world conditions.

## ðŸ’¼ Business Impact

1. **Fuel Efficiency Optimization**  
   Accurate fuel predictions help reduce **overloading**, lower aircraft weight, and improve in-flight **fuel efficiency**, directly lowering operational costs and emissions.

2. **Cost Savings**  
   With a prediction error margin of approximately **534 kg per flight**, OB Airways could save an estimated **$300â€“$600 USD per flight**, depending on fuel pricesâ€”adding up to **significant annual savings**.

3. **Enhanced Operational Planning**  
   Predictive insights allow flight planners to detect discrepancies between planned and expected fuel needs, enabling **data-driven decisions** for dispatch and ground operations.

4. **Sustainability and Compliance**  
   Minimizing fuel waste contributes to **lower COâ‚‚ emissions**, supporting OB Airwaysâ€™ **ESG goals** and compliance with **environmental regulations** in the aviation sector.

5. **Scalable AI Integration**  
   The ML pipeline is adaptable across different **aircraft types** and **flight routes**, making it feasible to deploy AI-based optimization **across the entire fleet**.
