## 🧪 1. Linear Regression (Baseline Model)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| MAE    | 1,785.23 kg |
| RMSE   | 2,773.34 kg |
| R²     | 0.9267 |

❗ While simple and interpretable, this model performs significantly worse than others in both error metrics and explanatory power.

## 🚀 3. XGBoost Regressor

| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| MAE    | 534.23 kg |
| RMSE   | 1,124.22 kg |
| R²     | 0.9880 |

✅ Best standalone performance.
✅ Well-suited for structured tabular data like flight logs.

## 🧠 4. Stacking Regressor (XGBoost + Linear Regression)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| MAE    | 540.24 kg |
| RMSE   | 1,143.56 kg |
| R²     | 0.9875 |

✅ Very competitive with XGBoost, combining the strengths of linear and nonlinear models.
✅ Slight trade-off in RMSE vs. XGBoost, but may generalize better in some edge cases.
