## 1. Linear Regression (Baseline Model)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| MAE    | 1,785.23 kg |
| RMSE   | 2,773.34 kg |
| R¬≤     | 0.9267 |

- While simple and interpretable, this model performs significantly worse than others in both error metrics and explanatory power.

---

## 2. Random Forest Regressor

| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| MAE    | 596.48 kg |
| RMSE   | 1,129.82 kg |
| R¬≤     | 0.9878 |

- Strong performance with low error and high R¬≤. Effectively captures nonlinear patterns without extensive tuning.

## 3. XGBoost Regressor

| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| MAE    | 534.23 kg |
| RMSE   | 1,124.22 kg |
| R¬≤     | 0.9880 |

- Best standalone performance.
- Well-suited for structured tabular data like flight logs.

## 4. Stacking Regressor (XGBoost + Linear Regression)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| MAE    | 540.24 kg |
| RMSE   | 1,143.56 kg |
| R¬≤     | 0.9875 |

- Very competitive with XGBoost, combining the strengths of linear and nonlinear models.
- Slight trade-off in RMSE vs. XGBoost, but may generalize better in some edge cases.

## Recommendation

- **Use XGBoost** as the primary deployment model for best performance.
- **Stacking Regressor** can be considered if the goal is robustness through ensembling.
- **Random Forest** is a solid alternative with similar performance and ease of interpretation.
- **Linear Regression** is only suitable as a baseline or quick benchmark.
